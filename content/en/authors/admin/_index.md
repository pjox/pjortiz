I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at [Sorbonne Université](https://sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and at the [ALMAnaCH research team](https://team.inria.fr/almanach/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/).

I work primarily in machine learning, deep learning and NLP.

I love coffee, cookies and coding.
