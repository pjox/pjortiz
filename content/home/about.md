# Biography

Iâ€™m a mathematician interested in Arithmetic Geometry, Artificial Intelligence, Complex Algebraic Geometry, Cryptography, and Deep Learning.

I've worked in Complex Geometry, Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Geometry.

In my spare time, I drink coffee, code and play [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29).
